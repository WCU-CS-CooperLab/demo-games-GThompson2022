Week: 1 Notes Coin Dash
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Learned about the starts of Coin Dash, and learned the difference between Scripting and influencing the player in the scene.
- Learned how to export to the GitHub repository.
- Understanding the Main Scenes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week: 2 Notes - Coin Dash pt. 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Learning the beginnings of UI and HUD scene logic in GODOT. Understanding how to manipulate scenes and instantiate children nodes from other scenes to play.
- Finished CoinDash, but I am still reading the book to figure out how to add obstacles and sound effects to the game.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week: 3 Notes - Space Rocks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Beginning of Space Rocks Player Scene. Trying to fully understand the Animation Player.
- Added shooting mechanics using a Bullet with Sprite2d, CollisionShape2d, with assets as well as the background.
- Space Rocks I believe I messed up the Player Scene so I need to go back and change that, however the bullet scene and explosion scene seem to work well.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week: 4 Notes - Space Rocks pt.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Finished up the explosions, and finished the player scene so it runs properly, had to restart the project on my own to figure that one out.
- Explosions work out well now and doing all the other Quality of life stuff such as pausing the game, and the start screen.
- I want to continue and finish up the game from the book.
- I got to the powerups on my own, but need to focus on 3D Mini Golf now.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week: 5 Notes - Mini Golf
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Learning 3D games for the first time is very confusing. My laptop does not like it very much. Using Shift + f to free roam around really helps get the perspective you need.
- Struggled making the first course, I either shrank the tiles, or was on a wrong tile layer, I need to restart this and work on it at home.
- Making the Golf Ball, and Arrow made a lot of sense, struggled with some of the collision, understanding how to setup the tee and hole collision box was frustrating. Had to adjust the positioning ALOT!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week: 6 Notes - Jungle Jump
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Started Jungle Jump, immediately I was a little lost with project settings and animation player stuff. Finding the correct frames and animations and keyframing them was very difficult. I got about half but have to work on them at home to finalize them.
- I am sick and cannot attend class, but did some work at home with the textbook, finished up making the collectible Items, as well as the animations.
- Creating the first level with the tilemaps was confusing for sure, I am not very good at art, and doing this on my own would be difficult.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week: 7 Notes - Jungle Jump pt.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Making the enemies was fun, I enjoyed making them actually able to move and collide with the player, I will definitely be using this for one of my projects, it has been pretty fun to create, but I have messed up a lot on random lines of script. It has been rewarding finishing up the game
- The UI was not working very well, for some reason the container for the hearts was messing up and was off the screen.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week: 8 Notes - Infinite Flyer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Infinite flyer's instructions confused me a lot, the textbook has several mistakes, I think it must have been written for GODOT 3 and not the version that I have. I was struggling with the collision a lot. There were properties I could not find for the life of me.
- Building the world was fine, however, not my favorite.
- I am interested in finishing this project in my own time to finish up and implement powerups.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week: 9 - Team Project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- My team and I created a very ambitious team project game, and because of this, I have been working for hours at home in-order to keep up and not let my team down.
- I have had a lot of fun with this project, but learning the GitHub aspect of it, and trying to figure out how to fix parsing errors has been terrible.
